any comments with "-B" are parts of the code I directly implemented other parts may be AI written/ help from AI, maybe with some edits from me.
Mostly used this time to learn new coding topics and ideas through AI and make up in time and members with AI. So a good chunk of this was written by AI, however I still learned a lot through AI such as creating variables in JS, calling and creating functions in JS, and conditional statements in JS. I also learned a lot about postiioning, flex, grid, hover effects, background rgba, blur effects, and dynamic responsiveness. HTML I mostly already knew, but I did learn to use div nesting a lot better. Overall this was really fun.
